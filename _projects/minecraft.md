excerpt: This project implements a voxel world engine in C++, inspired by Minecraft. The OpenGL loader (GLAD) was written from scratch (version 0.1.36, targeting OpenGL 3.3 core) and is integrated directly into the engine. We engineered the math subsystem, custom shaders, lighting, world rendering, and related graphics fundamentals ourselves. All matrix/vector transformations, shader compilation and linking, illumination (e.g. directional/ambient lighting, shadows, etc.), and voxel meshing are handled in-engine without reliance on higher-level abstractions.
